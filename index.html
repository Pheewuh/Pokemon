 	<p id='description'>This text based game is my first complete python project. It took about 5-6 hours as I was still a rookie. This game is just a scene from any retro pokemon games where you play a pokemon battle. The cool thing about it is every aspect of this game is fully customizable. I had been looking to imrove the game from time to time and I have the ability to do that but I get carried away with other project ideas everytime. So it still has an unfinished vibe to it. But it would still be great if you checked it out. I have provided the github link at the bottom. Here are some previews:</p>
